## About Security Header Validator

Security Header Validator is a Python tool designed to detect missing security headers and use of deprecated headers, based on the OWASP Secure Headers Project. 
It provides a simple way to identify potential security risks associated with the headers sent by web servers.
You can easily add your custom headers and it's best practices to test your servers with our tool.

Security Header Validator detects:
 - Missing security headers
 - Use of deprecated security headers
 - Use of recommended security headers

Security Header Validator is written to be modular and hackable, you can easily add your headers.

```

## Usage

Short Form    | Long Form | Description
------------- |-----------|-------------
-t            | --target  | target url eg. https://exapmle_site.com
-h            | --help    | show the help message and exit


* Specify target with -t variable. Provide the full url as below.

`python scanner.py -t https://exapmle_site.com`

## How do I add a new header?

By following steps below you can add and integrate your headers to Security Header Validator.

1 - Navigate to headers folder and create the <header_name>.py file eg. user_agent.py

2 - Copy the contents of template_header.py into your header file.

3 - Modify your header file as needed.

4 - Find the list variable "header_files" in the header_compiler.py

5 - Append the file name to header_files eg.   
    ```
    header_files = ["x_content_type_options.py", "user_agent.py"]
    ```

Optinal: Test your headers. Append the file name to header_files in test_headers.py. 
Run the test_headers.py to ensure that your header file works correctly. 
    ```
    pytest test_headers.py
    ```

#### Warnings
Header file names should not contain dashes. Instead use underscore. This is to prevent import errors.

Correct: user_agent.py
Incorrect: user-agent.py


## Unit-test

* Requires pytest

Navigate to projects directory and run the command below to test if your
headers work.
`pytest tests/test_headers.py`

## To Do

- [ ] List argument to scan a url list.
- [ ] Max request argument to limit requests per second.
- [ ] Detect information disclosures in headers
- [ ] Detect misconfigurations of security headers.
